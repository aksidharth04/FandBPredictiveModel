F&B PROCESS ANOMALY PREDICTION - PROBLEM STATEMENT

QUESTION: 3
GROUP: Group 1
SECTION: Section 1

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
Develop an industrial F&B (food & beverage) process anomaly prediction system. Process anomaly is defined as deviations of final product quality while it is being manufactured.

BACKGROUND:
The food and beverage industry in India is a dynamic and rapidly growing sector. It encompasses a wide range of activities, including food processing, packaging, distribution, and retail. The industry is driven by several factors such as increasing urbanization, rising disposable incomes, and changing consumer preferences.

India is known for its diverse culinary traditions, which contribute to the richness of the food and beverage market. The country has a large agricultural base, providing a variety of raw materials for food processing. Additionally, the growth of organized retail and e-commerce platforms has made it easier for consumers to access a wide range of food and beverage products.

The industry also faces challenges such as regulatory compliance, supply chain management, and the need for innovation to meet evolving consumer demands. However, with the government's support and initiatives like 'Make in India,' the sector is poised for significant growth and development. Overall, the food and beverage industry in India offers immense opportunities for businesses and entrepreneurs, making it a vital part of the country's economy. The quality of the food and beverage industry in India faces several challenges that impact its growth and consumer trust.

CHALLENGE:
Designing predictive maintenance system for a process line of a F&B process such as baked good, Frozen foods or dairy products (choose any product of your choice based on available public data) by collecting different process variables data & build predictive ML to identify possible quality alert.

CONSTRAINTS:
Collect multi variable Process data - raw material quantity deviations equipment parameters such as mixer rotation speed process temperature time of mixing etc. Find a typical process line.

EXPECTATIONS/DELIVERABLES:

1. Identify F&B manufacturing process steps, raw materials details, process equipment control parameters, and definition of product quality. For example, for bakery goods, this includes specifying raw materials and their quantities for each product type, process equipment (like mixers, raisers, ovens), and final product quality parameters. A complete explanation of the process steps is required.

2. Add all relevant references and publicly available dataset downloaded.

3. Identify relevant data streams (time series & discrete) for both input raw material (quantity, pH, Rh, temperature) and process equipment parameters. These can be sourced from any public data repositories, but their helpfulness must be justified.

4. Define final product quality as per chosen product type. For "baked goods," this involves researching suitable quantification methods such as "core temperature after baking, final weight, visual observation (discrete data - brown, charred, semi charred etc)."

5. Develop a multivariable prediction model based on both raw material deviations & process parameters deviations. Attaching a working Python code is compulsory.

6. Develop a dashboard to visualize real-time process data and predicted product quality.

SAMPLE DATASET (for reference only):
A sample dataset is provided for baked food products. It contains information on raw material weight, different process temperatures, mixer speed, etc., for various batches. The quality of the final product is quantified based on final weight and a quality score.

Important Note: The provided dataset is for reference only and does not include all manufacturing process steps. Candidates are expected to conduct their own research to fully understand the process steps of the selected product. This understanding must be clearly explained in the submitted report with relevant datasets and references. The final dataset created by the candidate must include all relevant parameters. Using publicly available datasets is highly encouraged.

An attached Excel dataset is mentioned: FnB_Process_Data_Batch_Wise.xlsx.

FAQs:

1. What datasets are good for developing a multi-variable prediction model?
   Students are encouraged to identify public data, specifically looking for "equipment process data: furnace temperature profile (temperature at different locations), heater current etc."

2. Will Honeywell provide any data sets?
   A sample dataset is shared above, but students are advised to identify suitable typical equipment process data themselves.

3. What is the report format?
   Students are instructed to use a provided template but are also encouraged to prepare a detailed report addressing the expected outcome of their work during the Hackathon.

KEY DELIVERABLES:

Preprocessing of Data (Quality of Data):
a. Apply statistical methods to analyze data quality and document the techniques used.
b. Identify and filter out outlier data points, demonstrating the improvement graphically.
c. Justify the quantification of data quality.

Process Overview:
a. Describe the chosen F&B process, including complete manufacturing steps, raw material details, process equipment control parameters, and the definition of product quality.
b. Provide insights into the understanding of process variations.
c. Include all relevant references.

APPLICATION OF MACHINE LEARNING MODEL:

1. Application of Machine Learning model:
   a. Upload the code.
   b. Attach the relevant dataset (Add link to the dataset).
   c. Provide your justification on choosing the particular ML algorithm.

2. Results and Interferences:
   a. Please present the important model results, preferably graphically.
   b. Apply engineering judgement to infer on the pattern of multi-variable process variation.

   a. Provide a visualization schematic of the real-time process data and predicted product quality.

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
Your output needs to be uploaded as pdf file(s) only, using the "Upload Files" option below. You also need to provide an outline of your submission in the text box below. The outline should contain:

1. Proposed Solution (Describe your Idea/Solution/Prototype):
   - Detailed explanation of the proposed solution
   - How it addresses the problem
   - Innovation and uniqueness of the solution

2. Technical Approach:
   - Technologies to be used (e.g. programming languages, frameworks, hardware)
   - Methodology and process for implementation (Flow Charts/Images/ working prototype)

3. Feasibility and Viability:
   - Analysis of the feasibility of the idea
   - Potential challenges and risks
   - Strategies for overcoming these challenges

4. Research and References:
   - Details / Links of the reference and research work

OVERALL OBJECTIVE:
The primary objective is to familiarize students with typical industrial process control, specifically focusing on Food & Beverage (F&B) processes, using baked goods (like oven and dough mixer operations) as examples. The core challenge is understanding how an oven maintains its required temperature profile despite fluctuations, emphasizing closed-loop control systems and potential deviations.

KEY QUESTIONS AND INSTRUCTIONS:

1. Data Identification: Students are encouraged to identify and use public data, specifically "equipment process data" such as "furnace temperature profile (temperature at different locations), heater current etc."

2. Data Provision: Honeywell provides a "sample dataset" but advises students to identify a "suitable data set" that includes "typical equipment process data."

3. Report Format: A template is provided for capturing key aspects, but students are encouraged to prepare a "detailed report" addressing the expected outcome of their work during the Hackathon.

4. Multi-variable Predictive Model: Students are explicitly asked to "use a suitable ML algorithm" to "capture variability of chosen parameters into an explainable model" with an understanding of F&B equipment/machinery control processes. Justification for the chosen algorithm is required.

5. Starting Point (F&B Understanding): The problem guides students to focus on understanding industrial process control, using baked goods as an example, and specifically how an oven maintains temperature profiles through heater control and closed-loop systems.
